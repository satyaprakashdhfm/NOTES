    "## 🔄 **Synchronous vs Asynchronous Nature**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **The Reality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Language | **Nature** | **Key Point** |\n",
    "|----------|------------|---------------|\n",
    "| **JavaScript** | **Asynchronous by design** | Event loop, non-blocking I/O |\n",
    "| **Java** | **Synchronous by default** | But can do async with threads |\n",
    "| **Python** | **Synchronous by default** | But has async capabilities |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Important Distinction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Languages themselves aren't inherently sync/async** - it's about:\n",
    "1. **Default behavior** \n",
    "2. **How easy it is** to write async code\n",
    "3. **Runtime architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Detailed Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**JavaScript (Node.js)**:\n",
    "- **Naturally asynchronous** - everything is non-blocking by default\n",
    "- **Single-threaded** with event loop\n",
    "- **Async is the norm** (callbacks, promises, async/await)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Java**:\n",
    "- **Synchronous by default** - one line executes after another\n",
    "- **Multi-threaded** - can run multiple things simultaneously\n",
    "- **Async requires work** (CompletableFuture, reactive streams)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python**:\n",
    "- **Synchronous by default** - similar to Java\n",
    "- **Async support added later** (asyncio, async/await since Python 3.5)\n",
    "- **Choice between sync and async** approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Web Framework Behavior:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Framework | Default Behavior | Async Support |\n",
    "|-----------|------------------|---------------|\n",
    "| **Express.js** | Async (non-blocking) | ✅ Built-in |\n",
    "| **Spring Boot** | Sync (blocking) | ✅ Available (WebFlux) |\n",
    "| **Django** | Sync (blocking) | ✅ Available (ASGI) |\n",
    "| **FastAPI** | **Async-first** | ✅ Native async |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 **Key Takeaway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JavaScript** = Async by nature\n",
    "- **Java & Python** = Sync by default, async when needed\n",
    "- **Modern frameworks** in all languages support both patterns\n",
    "- The choice depends on your **use case** (I/O heavy = async better, CPU heavy = sync often fine)\n",
    "\n",
    "So JavaScript is the odd one out - it's **async-first**, while Java and Python are **sync-first** with async capabilities!"

    "\n",
    "> **What it means:**\n",
    "> This is the *typical* time it takes for the backend to respond to a request.\n",
    "> If you send 100 requests, about 50 of them will take **less than or equal to** this much time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How to think of it:**\n",
    "> It’s like asking, “What’s the average speed of a normal reply from this backend?”\n",
    "> Lower = snappier feeling for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    " 🟨 **2. Throughput (RPS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What it means:**\n",
    "> This is how many requests per second (RPS) the backend can handle while still working well.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How to think of it:**\n",
    "> It’s like the speed of a printer — how many pages (responses) it can give per second.\n",
    "> Higher = more users it can handle at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟧 **3. Concurrency Threshold**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What it means:**\n",
    "> This is roughly how many users can send requests *at the same time* before the system starts slowing down badly (e.g. responses take longer than 1 second).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How to think of it:**\n",
    "> Think of it like a restaurant: how many people it can serve before the kitchen gets overwhelmed and orders slow down.\n",

    "🟥 **4. Memory Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What it means:**\n",
    "> How much RAM the backend app typically uses — idle and under stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How to think of it:**\n",
    "> Like how much fuel the engine burns. More memory = heavier, possibly more expensive to host.\n",
    "> Lower = lighter, cheaper to run — but may trade off features or speed.\n",
