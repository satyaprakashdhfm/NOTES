    "### 🟩 Node.js Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Server**: A server in Node.js is a program that listens to incoming client requests and sends appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Loop**: The event loop is the core mechanism in Node.js that handles asynchronous operations in a non-blocking way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callback**: A callback is a function passed into another function to be executed later, often after an async task completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-blocking I/O**: This refers to input/output operations that don’t block the execution of other code, enabling high performance in Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous**: Asynchronous means tasks run in the background, letting the rest of the code continue without waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middleware**: Middleware is a function that processes requests between the server receiving them and the final response being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Express**: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web framework used to build APIs and web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing**: Routing refers to how a server handles different HTTP methods and paths (like GET `/users` or POST `/login`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module**: A module is a file that encapsulates code and can be imported or reused in other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**require()**: The `require()` function is used to import a module or library in a Node.js file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**exports / module.exports**: These are used to define what parts of a module can be accessed from outside that module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is the tool used to install, manage, and update packages and dependencies in Node.js projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**package.json**: This file holds metadata about your project and a list of all dependencies used in your Node.js app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**fs (File System)**: The `fs` module lets you interact with the file system, such as reading or writing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**path**: The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**http**: The `http` module allows you to create HTTP servers and handle requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API (Application Programming Interface)**: An API is a set of rules that allows software applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSON**: JSON is a format for storing and exchanging structured data using key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment Variables**: These are values set outside of your code, usually for configuration like database credentials or ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "**dotenv**: The `dotenv` package loads environment variables from a `.env` file into your app automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature that controls which domains can access your resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling**: This is the process of catching and responding to runtime errors to keep the app from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Promise**: A promise is a special object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**async/await**: These are modern JavaScript keywords for writing cleaner, promise-based asynchronous code.\n"

    "\n",
    "### ✅ 1. What is NPM?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NPM** is Node.js's dependency manager and build tool, just like Maven handles Java projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Manages**: Dependencies, scripts, builds, and deployments\n",
    "* **Main file**: `package.json` (equivalent to Maven's `pom.xml`)\n",
    "* **Install location**: `node_modules/` folder (like Maven's `.m2/repository`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key differences from Maven**:\n",
    "- NPM installs packages locally in each project\n",
    "- Maven shares dependencies globally in local repository\n",
    "- NPM uses semantic versioning more strictly\n",
    "\n",

    "### 📦 Project Structure Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**NPM manages two types of projects**:\n",
    "1. **Applications** - Complete web apps (like Spring Boot projects)\n",
    "2. **Packages** - Reusable libraries (like JAR files)\n",

    "**Key concept**: Node.js database libraries handle **connections automatically**, unlike Java where you manually manage connection pools.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Database Patterns (ORM Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entity Definition** (like JPA `@Entity`):\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repository Pattern**: \n",
    "- **Java**: `UserRepository extends JpaRepository`\n",
    "- **Node.js**: Built into ORM (User.find(), User.create())\n",

    "**Key insight**: Node.js ORMs combine the Entity and Repository patterns into one model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Transaction Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Java approach**: `@Transactional` annotation\n",
    "**Node.js approach**: Manual session management\n",

    "### 🎯 Architecture Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "**3-Layer Architecture** (same as Spring):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Controller Layer** - Handle HTTP requests\n",
    "2. **Service Layer** - Business logic\n",
    "3. **Repository Layer** - Database operations\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is JWT?**\n",
    "- A **string token** containing user information\n",
    "- **Stateless** - server doesn't store session data\n",
    "- **Self-contained** - token has all needed info\n",
    "\n",
    "**JWT Structure**: `header.payload.signature`\n",
    "- **Header**: Token type and algorithm\n",
    "- **Payload**: User data (id, email, roles)\n",
    "- **Signature**: Verification hash\n",
    "\n",
    "**Java equivalent**: Spring Security's JWT implementation works the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔒 Authentication Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Login Process**:\n",
    "1. User sends username/password\n",
    "2. Server verifies credentials\n",
    "3. Server creates JWT token\n",
    "4. Client stores token\n",
    "5. Client sends token with every request\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authorization Process**:\n",
    "1. Extract token from request headers\n",
    "2. Verify token signature\n",
    "3. Get user info from token\n",
    "4. Allow or deny access\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: This flow is **identical** in Java Spring Security and Node.js.\n",
