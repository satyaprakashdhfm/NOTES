    "### 🟩 Node.js Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Server**: A server in Node.js is a program that listens to incoming client requests and sends appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Loop**: The event loop is the core mechanism in Node.js that handles asynchronous operations in a non-blocking way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callback**: A callback is a function passed into another function to be executed later, often after an async task completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-blocking I/O**: This refers to input/output operations that don’t block the execution of other code, enabling high performance in Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous**: Asynchronous means tasks run in the background, letting the rest of the code continue without waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middleware**: Middleware is a function that processes requests between the server receiving them and the final response being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Express**: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web framework used to build APIs and web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing**: Routing refers to how a server handles different HTTP methods and paths (like GET `/users` or POST `/login`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module**: A module is a file that encapsulates code and can be imported or reused in other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**require()**: The `require()` function is used to import a module or library in a Node.js file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**exports / module.exports**: These are used to define what parts of a module can be accessed from outside that module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is the tool used to install, manage, and update packages and dependencies in Node.js projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**package.json**: This file holds metadata about your project and a list of all dependencies used in your Node.js app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**fs (File System)**: The `fs` module lets you interact with the file system, such as reading or writing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**path**: The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**http**: The `http` module allows you to create HTTP servers and handle requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API (Application Programming Interface)**: An API is a set of rules that allows software applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSON**: JSON is a format for storing and exchanging structured data using key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment Variables**: These are values set outside of your code, usually for configuration like database credentials or ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "**dotenv**: The `dotenv` package loads environment variables from a `.env` file into your app automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature that controls which domains can access your resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling**: This is the process of catching and responding to runtime errors to keep the app from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Promise**: A promise is a special object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**async/await**: These are modern JavaScript keywords for writing cleaner, promise-based asynchronous code.\n"
