    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "7️⃣ API Security Best Practices \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs need security to prevent unauthorized access. \n",
    "\n",
    "🔒 Key security measures: \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Use HTTPS – Encrypt API requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Validate Input – Prevent SQL Injection & XSS. \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Rate Limiting – Limit the number of requests per user. \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ OAuth2 / JWT – Secure authentication. \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) – Restrict API access to allowed domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Example of rate limiting: \n",
    "\n",
    "If an API allows only 100 requests per minute, any extra request will get 429 Too Many Requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "8️⃣ API Deployment \n",
    "\n",
    "Once your API is built, you can deploy it using: \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Cloud services – AWS, Azure, GCP. \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Docker + Kubernetes – For scalable deployments. \n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Defined Routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE): \n",
    "\n",
    "In main.py, we created a FastAPI app with multiple HTTP methods: \n",
    "\n",
    "GET (@app.get(\"/items\")): Fetches a list of items, optionally accepting query parameters for pagination (skip and limit). \n",
    "\n",
    "POST (@app.post(\"/items/\")): Accepts JSON data to create a new item, validating it with Pydantic (which makes sure the data follows the correct structure). \n",
    "\n",
    "PUT (@app.put(\"/items/{item_id}\")): Updates an existing item based on the provided item ID. \n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE (@app.delete(\"/items/{item_id}\")): Deletes an item by ID. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ran the FastAPI Server (Uvicorn): \n",
    "\n",
    "We started the FastAPI server using Uvicorn, which runs the FastAPI app and listens for incoming requests on port 8000. \n",
    "\n",
    "The command uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000: \n",
    "\n",
    "main:app points to the FastAPI app defined in main.py. \n",
    "\n",
    "--reload makes the server automatically restart when code changes are detected. \n",
    "\n",
    "--host 0.0.0.0 allows the server to be accessible from any device in the network (useful if testing outside of WSL). \n",
    "\n",
    "--port 8000 specifies the port number (8000) for the server to listen to \n",

    "When connecting from your host machine, using the container’s internal hostname (like \"07be54f9a6c7\") won’t work because that name is only resolvable within the container’s Docker network. Instead, you should connect to the mapped port on your host. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you mapped port 1433 of the container to port 1433 on your host (as in your docker-compose or run command), you should run: \n",
    "\n",
    "sqlcmd -S localhost,1433 -U sa -P \"Scam@1992\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This tells sqlcmd to connect to SQL Server on localhost at port 1433. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Docker Compose, verify that your ports section for the mssql service is correctly mapping (e.g., \"1433:1433\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "The container's hostname (like \"07be54f9a6c7\") is only useful for communication between containers on the same network. \n",

    " Good question! A Python script can send its own code by reading itself using the special variable __file__. Here’s how it works: \n",
    "\n",
    "How Does the Code Submit Itself? \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "python \n",

    "CopyEdit \n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\" \n",

    "with open(__file__, \"r\") as f: \n",
    "\n",
    "    script_content = f.read() \n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\" \n",
    "\n",
    "__file__ contains the filename of the current script. \n",
    "\n",
    "open(__file__, \"r\") opens the script in read mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "f.read() reads the entire content of the script. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script is then sent as raw text in the POST request. \n",
    "\n",
    "if you can use the GETmethod on a URL and it returns a meaningful response, that URL is considered an endpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "if the API requires authentication in the headers, then just putting the API key in the URL won't work. \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is possible to have multiple URLs before reaching an endpointin an API. This can happen in different ways, such as API gateways, authentication layers, and proxy servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios Where Multiple URLs Exist Before an Endpoint \n",
    "\n",
    "API Gateway as an Initial Entry Point \n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern APIs use an API gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Kong, Nginx) before routing requests to the actual endpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "1st URL (API Gateway): https://gateway.example.com/api \n",
    "2nd URL (Microservice): https://users.example.com/users/123 \n",
    "\n",
    "The client interacts with the gateway, and the gateway routes the request to the correct microservice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication and Token Exchange Before Reaching an Endpoint \n",
    "\n",
    "Some APIs require an authentication request before accessing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "1st URL (Auth Request): https://auth.example.com/token  (Get API Token) \n",
    "2nd URL (API Endpoint): https://api.example.com/users/123  (Use Token to Fetch Data) \n",
    "\n",
    "The user first gets an authentication token and then uses it to access the actual API endpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse Proxy or Load Balancer \n",
    "\n",
    "A reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) might sit in front of an API to distribute requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "1st URL (Reverse Proxy): https://proxy.example.com/api \n",
    "2nd URL (Backend API): https://internal-api.example.com/users/123 \n",
    "\n",
    "The proxy handles external requests and forwards them to the actual API servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Versioning or Subdomains in API Architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs may have different URLs for versioning or subdomain separation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "1st URL (Versioning): https://api.example.com/v1/ \n",
    "2nd URL (Endpoint): https://api.example.com/v1/users/123 \n",
    "\n",
    "The first URL sets the version, and the second is the actual API call. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, an API request can pass through multiple URLsbefore reaching the actual endpoint due to authentication, API gateways, proxies, or versioning. This design helps in scalability, security, and performance optimization. \n",

    "WebSockets themselves aren’t \"two types\"—they’re a single protocol. However, how you implement them in your application can vary: \n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronous (Blocking) Implementation: \n",
    "You might use blocking database calls or other I/O inside a WebSocket handler. In an async framework like FastAPI, this can block the event loop unless you offload the work (e.g., using a thread pool). \n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous (Non-blocking) Implementation: \n",
    "You can use non-blocking (async) libraries to handle I/O. This way, the WebSocket can push data without blocking other tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier example, the WebSocket endpoint is asynchronous, but the database query is synchronous (using pyodbc). For a fully non-blocking approach, you’d need an async DB library or run the query in a separate thread. \n",
    "\n",
    "So it’s not that WebSockets come in two types; it’s more about how you implement and manage I/O   \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that's essentially it. Your website (client) will refresh its display based on the data received from the server, which is continuously polling (or being notified) of updates from the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our WebSocket example, for instance: \n",
    "\n",
    "The server repeatedly queries the database (polling at a set interval or using an event-driven approach). \n",
    "\n",
    "When new data is available, it sends that update over the WebSocket. \n",
    "\n",
    "The website (client) listens for these updates and refreshes the displayed data in near real‑time. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, while the website only refreshes when new data arrives (or at set intervals), the server is continuously fetching fresh data from the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, our WebSocket endpoint is defined as an asynchronous function, which is great for handling many connections concurrently. However, the database query itself is synchronous (using pyodbc), meaning that while the WebSocket can wait non‑blockingly (using await asyncio.sleep), the actual query will block the event loop when it runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve this, you have two main options: \n",
    "\n",
    "Offload Synchronous Queries to a Thread: \n",
    "Use something like asyncio.to_thread() to run the blocking pyodbc calls in a separate thread, which prevents them from blocking the event loop. This way, your WebSocket remains fully asynchronous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use an Asynchronous Database Library: \n",
    "Instead of pyodbc, use an async library (e.g., aioodbc or pytds for SQL Server) that supports asynchronous operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For small workloads, the current approach might work fine, but for heavy loads or high concurrency, offloading blocking calls is recommended. \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronous code waits for each operation to finish before moving on, so tasks are executed one after the other (blocking). In contrast, asynchronous code allows other operations to run while waiting for a task to complete (non-blocking), which can improve performance when dealing with I/O operations like network or database calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronous(blocking): \n",
    "Imagine you’re making a phone call, waiting on hold, and not doing anything else until the call is finished. \n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous(non-blocking): \n",
    "Instead of waiting on hold, you place the call, then go about your day. When the call is answered, you get a notification and continue the conversation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, using async/await allows you to write asynchronous code so your program can handle multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for each to complete sequentially. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Real-Time Communication (WebServer) vs Periodic Polling (HttpServer) \n",
    "\n",
    "HttpServer (HTTP Polling): \n",
    "\n",
    "Client sends a request to the webserver to check for updates (e.g., every 1 sec). \n",
    "\n",
    "Webserver queries the DBServer for updated sensor data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Webserver sends a response to the client with the current state, even if no new data is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "❗️ Wastes bandwidth and increases webserver load due to unnecessary requests. \n",

    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. 🔥 Lower Latency and Faster Response Time \n",
    "\n",
    "HttpServer: \n",
    "\n",
    "Delay between updates depends on polling interval (e.g., 1 sec or 5 sec). \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if DBServer data changes immediately, client waits until the next request. \n",
    "\n",
    "WebServer: \n",
    "\n",
    "Pushes updates from DBServer as soon as data changes. \n",

    "🎯 Why WebServer (WebSocket) is Better for Your Sensor Data? \n",
    "\n",
    "Your DBServer updates sensor data at different intervals (15s and 30s). \n",
    "\n",
    "With HttpServer: \n",
    "\n",
    "Small intervals → High load on webserver and DBServer. \n",
