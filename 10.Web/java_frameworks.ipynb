    "## 🚀 **Spring Boot Vocabulary – Complete & Organized**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ 🔧 **Spring Boot Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spring Boot**: A rapid development framework that simplifies Spring apps with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and minimal setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures beans and settings based on classpath dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Starter**: A pre-packaged dependency group (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`) that simplifies setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedded Server**: Spring Boot applications run with built-in web servers (e.g., Tomcat) — no separate deployment needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**application.properties / application.yml**: Files used to configure server port, database URL, credentials, profiles, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@SpringBootApplication**: A shortcut for `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@EnableAutoConfiguration**: Tells Spring Boot to automatically configure the app based on dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@ComponentScan**: Instructs Spring to look for components, configurations, and services in the specified package.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CommandLineRunner**: Interface used to run specific code once the Spring Boot application context is loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DevTools**: Provides hot reload and auto-restart support for faster development feedback cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actuator**: A module that adds production-ready features like health checks, metrics, env info, and endpoint monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ 🧩 **Annotations and Bean Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Component**: Declares a class as a Spring-managed component or bean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Service**: Specialized component used to mark business logic classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Repository**: Specialized component for data access layers (DAOs) that also supports exception translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@RestController**: A combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, returning data (e.g., JSON) directly to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Controller**: Handles HTTP requests and returns views (like HTML).\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Autowired**: Automatically injects beans into other beans (e.g., services into controllers).\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Value**: Injects values from configuration properties or environment variables into fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ 🧱 **Dependency Injection (DI) vs Maven**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maven**: A build tool that manages project structure, dependencies, plugins, and build lifecycle using `pom.xml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependency Injection (DI)**: A design pattern where Spring automatically injects required objects (beans) into dependent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Important distinction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maven brings libraries into your project via `pom.xml`.\n",
    "* Spring DI injects actual **runtime objects** (beans) into your classes using annotations like `@Autowired`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ 🧪 **Testing and Plugins (Spring + Maven)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**JUnit**: A unit testing framework for Java (used by default in Spring Boot projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mockito**: A mocking framework used to simulate dependencies in unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AssertJ / Hamcrest**: Libraries that provide fluent assertions for test readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spring Security Test Plugins**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@WithMockUser`, `@WithUserDetails`: Simulate logged-in users in test scenarios.\n",
    "* Ability to mock **SecurityContext**, simulate role-based access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ 🧭 **Web Architecture: MVC & DOM**\n",
    "\n",
    "**MVC (Model-View-Controller)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model**: Represents application data (usually from the database).\n",
    "* **View**: Defines how data is displayed to the user (HTML, Thymeleaf, etc.).\n",
    "* **Controller**: Receives HTTP requests and coordinates between Model and View.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DOM (Document Object Model)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DOM** is not part of Spring Boot; it’s relevant in frontend frameworks like React or browser-side JavaScript.\n",
    "* Spring can return HTML that’s interpreted by the browser’s DOM, but it does **not manage the DOM** directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6️⃣ 🧠 **OOP Principles & Software Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "**IoC (Inversion of Control)**: Spring handles object creation and lifecycle — you don’t `new` objects manually; Spring wires them for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bean**: A Java object managed by the Spring IoC container.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interface-based Decoupling**: Business logic is implemented in interfaces and injected via DI — promotes testability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open/Closed Principle (SOLID)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code should be **open for extension** (you can add new features),\n",
    "* But **closed for modification** (you don’t rewrite existing logic).\n",
    "  Spring enables this with annotations and configuration-based overrides.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7️⃣ 🗃️ **Data and Persistence Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Entity**: Marks a class as a database table representation (JPA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Id**: Specifies the primary key field of the entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@GeneratedValue**: Automatically generates values for the primary key (e.g., auto-increment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**JpaRepository / CrudRepository**: Interfaces that provide out-of-the-box CRUD operations for your entities.\n",
    "\n"
