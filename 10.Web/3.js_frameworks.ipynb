    "\n",
    "**Server**: A server in Node.js is a program that listens to incoming client requests and sends appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Loop**: The event loop is the core mechanism in Node.js that handles asynchronous operations in a non-blocking way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callback**: A callback is a function passed into another function to be executed later, often after an async task completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-blocking I/O**: This refers to input/output operations that don’t block the execution of other code, enabling high performance in Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous**: Asynchronous means tasks run in the background, letting the rest of the code continue without waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middleware**: Middleware is a function that processes requests between the server receiving them and the final response being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Express**: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web framework used to build APIs and web applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Module**: A module is a file that encapsulates code and can be imported or reused in other files.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**path**: The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**http**: The `http` module allows you to create HTTP servers and handle requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API (Application Programming Interface)**: An API is a set of rules that allows software applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSON**: JSON is a format for storing and exchanging structured data using key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment Variables**: These are values set outside of your code, usually for configuration like database credentials or ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "**dotenv**: The `dotenv` package loads environment variables from a `.env` file into your app automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature that controls which domains can access your resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling**: This is the process of catching and responding to runtime errors to keep the app from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Promise**: A promise is a special object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**async/await**: These are modern JavaScript keywords for writing cleaner, promise-based asynchronous code.\n"

    "### 🟦 React.js Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component**: A component is a reusable piece of UI that can be a JavaScript function or class returning JSX.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSX**: JSX is a syntax that combines JavaScript with HTML-like tags to create UI elements in React.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Props**: Props are inputs passed to a component to configure its content or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**State**: State is an object that stores dynamic data that determines how a component renders and behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**useState**: The `useState` hook lets functional components manage and update state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**useEffect**: The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects like fetching data or setting up subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hook**: A hook is a function that lets you use React features like state and lifecycle in functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lifecycle Methods**: These are functions in class components that run at specific points like mounting, updating, or unmounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Virtual DOM**: The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the UI that React uses to optimize rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rendering**: Rendering is the act of displaying UI elements on the screen based on component logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional Rendering**: Conditional rendering means showing different content based on conditions like state or props.\n",
    "\n",
    "**List Rendering**: List rendering is when you loop over data (like an array) and render UI for each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key**: A key is a unique identifier used in lists to help React manage and update items efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Router**: A router allows navigation between different components/pages in a single-page React app.\n",
