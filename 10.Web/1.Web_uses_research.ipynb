    "🟩 **1. Median Latency**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What it means:**\n",
    "> This is the *typical* time it takes for the backend to respond to a request.\n",
    "> If you send 100 requests, about 50 of them will take **less than or equal to** this much time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How to think of it:**\n",
    "> It’s like asking, “What’s the average speed of a normal reply from this backend?”\n",
    "> Lower = snappier feeling for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    " 🟨 **2. Throughput (RPS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What it means:**\n",
    "> This is how many requests per second (RPS) the backend can handle while still working well.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How to think of it:**\n",
    "> It’s like the speed of a printer — how many pages (responses) it can give per second.\n",
    "> Higher = more users it can handle at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟧 **3. Concurrency Threshold**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What it means:**\n",
    "> This is roughly how many users can send requests *at the same time* before the system starts slowing down badly (e.g. responses take longer than 1 second).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How to think of it:**\n",
    "> Think of it like a restaurant: how many people it can serve before the kitchen gets overwhelmed and orders slow down.\n",
    "> Higher = better under pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟥 **4. Memory Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What it means:**\n",
    "> How much RAM the backend app typically uses — idle and under stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How to think of it:**\n",
    "> Like how much fuel the engine burns. More memory = heavier, possibly more expensive to host.\n",
    "> Lower = lighter, cheaper to run — but may trade off features or speed.\n",
    "\n"
