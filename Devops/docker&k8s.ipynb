    "## Docker Architecture and Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker requires Linux kernel features to run containers. On Windows, Docker integrates with WSL2 to provide a real Linux kernel. Docker containers are process-based and specific to applications, unlike VMs which create separate OS instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Linux Features Used by Docker:**\n",
    "- **Namespaces**: Provide isolation for processes, networks, filesystems\n",
    "- **Cgroups**: Control resource allocation (CPU, memory, I/O)  \n",
    "- **UnionFS/OverlayFS**: Layered filesystem for efficient storage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docker Engine Behavior:**\n",
    "- Starts when containers are running\n",
    "- Remains idle but running when no containers are active\n",
    "- Only stops when Docker service itself is stopped\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linux Kernel Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Namespaces\n",

    "- **UpperDir**: Writable layer for runtime changes\n",
    "- **MergedDir**: Combined view of all layers\n",
    "- **WorkDir**: Temporary workspace for operations\n",
    "\n",
