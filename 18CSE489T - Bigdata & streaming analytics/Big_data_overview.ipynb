    "- **JDBC drivers** to connect to databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)\n",
    "- **MapReduce jobs** to parallelize data transfer\n",
    "- **Code generation** - creates Java POJOs (not full ORM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why POJOs, Not ORM?\n",
    "Sqoop moves millions/billions of rows efficiently. ORM overhead would hurt performance.\n",

    "|--------|--------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| **Speed** | Slower - ORM overhead | Faster - Direct mapping |\n",
    "| **Memory** | Higher - metadata/proxies | Lower - just data fields |\n",
    "| **Parallelization** | Complex - session conflicts | Simple - stateless POJOs |\n",
    "| **Scalability** | Limited - app-level | Unlimited - scales with cluster |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sqoop Import Example\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "  --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/retail_db \\\n",
    "  --username root --password cloudera \\\n",

    "- Default mappers = 4 if not specified\n",
    "- Must specify --split-by when mappers > 1\n",
    "- Uses primary key as split-by if available\n",
    "- Map-only jobs (no reducers needed for direct copy)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Map-Only Jobs for Sqoop?\n",
    "1. **No aggregation needed** - direct copy from source to target\n",
    "2. **Parallel direct writes** - each mapper writes to HDFS\n",

    "- real comparision is hive vs spark-sql\n",
    "- Use Hive with map-reduce engine for slow batch jobs, Spark-sql for fast flexible processing.\n",
    "- hive on spark engine is called hive-on-spark.\n",
    "- SQL processing:\n",
    "    - Open Source: Apache Hive, Spark SQL (on Spark engine), Presto/Trino\n",
    "    - AWS: Redshift, Athena\n",
    "    - Azure: Synapse Analytics\n",

    "## Hive Complete Reference Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Managed vs External Table Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "• Managed Tables (Internal Tables)\n",
    "  - `CREATE TABLE employees (id INT, name STRING, salary DOUBLE);`\n",
    "  - Hive manages both metadata and data storage\n",
    "  - Data stored in Hive warehouse directory (`/user/hive/warehouse` by default)\n",
    "  - When table is dropped, both metadata and data are deleted permanently\n",
    "  - Hive has full control over table lifecycle\n",
    "    * Creates directories automatically\n",
    "    * Manages file organization\n",
    "    * Handles data cleanup on DROP TABLE\n",
    "  - Best for tables entirely managed by Hive applications\n",
    "  - Default table type when not specified\n",
    "\n",
    "• External Tables\n",
    "  - `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_employees (id INT, name STRING) LOCATION '/user/data/employees';`\n",
    "  - Hive manages only metadata, not the actual data files\n",
    "  - Data stored in user-specified location outside Hive warehouse\n",
    "  - When table is dropped, only metadata is removed, data remains intact\n",
    "  - Data can be shared across multiple applications and tools\n",
    "    * Other systems can read/write the same data\n",
    "    * Data persists beyond Hive table lifecycle\n",
    "    * Useful for data lakes and shared storage scenarios\n",
    "  - Required when data already exists in specific HDFS location\n",
    "  - Safer option when data should not be accidentally deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "• Key differences and selection criteria\n",
    "  - **Data ownership**: Managed tables owned by Hive, external tables owned by user\n",
    "  - **Drop behavior**: Managed tables delete data, external tables preserve data\n",
    "  - **Location control**: Managed tables use warehouse, external tables use custom paths\n",
    "  - **Use managed for**: Temporary tables, Hive-specific processing, ETL intermediates\n",
    "  - **Use external for**: Shared data, existing datasets, data lake scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Hive Table Types and Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "• Staging tables concept\n",
    "  - Temporary tables used for data preprocessing and validation\n",
    "  - `CREATE TABLE staging_sales (date STRING, amount STRING, product STRING);`\n",
    "  - Often use STRING data types initially for flexible data loading\n",
    "  - Used to clean, validate, and transform data before loading to production tables\n",
    "    * Handle data quality issues\n",
    "    * Perform data type conversions\n",
    "    * Apply business rules and validations\n",
    "  - Typically dropped after successful data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "• Dropping tables safely\n",
    "  - `DROP TABLE table_name;`: Removes table completely\n",
    "  - `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name;`: Prevents errors if table doesn't exist\n",
    "  - `TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;`: Removes all data but keeps table structure\n",
    "    * Faster than DELETE for removing all records\n",
    "    * Resets table to empty state\n",
    "    * Cannot be used with external tables\n",
    "  - `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PARTITION (year=2023);`: Remove specific partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "• Table creation variations\n",
    "  - `CREATE TABLE LIKE existing_table;`: Copy structure without data\n",
    "  - `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS);`: Create table with data from query\n",
    "  - `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_data (...);`: Session-specific tables\n",
    "    * Automatically dropped when session ends\n",
    "    * Not visible to other users or sessions\n",
    "    * Useful for intermediate processing steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Data Loading: Local vs HDFS Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "• Loading from local filesystem\n",
    "  - `LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/user/data.txt' INTO TABLE employees;`\n",
    "  - Copies data from local file system to HDFS\n",
    "  - Original file remains in local filesystem\n",
    "  - Data transferred over network to HDFS\n",
    "    * Slower for large files due to network transfer\n",
    "    * Useful for small datasets and development\n",
    "    * File must exist on machine running Hive client\n",
    "  - `OVERWRITE` option replaces existing data\n",
    "\n",
    "• Moving from HDFS\n",
    "  - `LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/data/employees.txt' INTO TABLE employees;`\n",
    "  - Moves data files from HDFS location to table location\n",
    "  - Original files are moved, not copied\n",
    "    * Much faster operation (metadata update only)\n",
    "    * No additional storage space required\n",
    "    * Source files no longer exist in original location\n",
    "  - Preferred method for large datasets already in HDFS\n",
    "  - Files must be compatible with table schema and format\n",
    "\n",
    "• Loading considerations and best practices\n",
    "  - **Performance**: HDFS move operations much faster than local copy\n",
    "  - **Data formats**: Ensure file format matches table definition\n",
    "  - **Partitioning**: Use partition specification for partitioned tables\n",
    "  - **File organization**: Multiple files loaded as separate data files\n",
    "  - **Permissions**: Ensure proper HDFS permissions for data access\n",
    "  - **Validation**: Test with small datasets before bulk loading\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Schema on Read Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "• Core concept and benefits\n",
    "  - Schema applied when data is read, not when data is written\n",
    "  - Data stored in raw format without immediate schema validation\n",
    "  - Flexible data ingestion without upfront schema definition\n",
    "    * Accept data in various formats and structures\n",
    "    * Handle schema evolution gracefully\n",
    "    * Support for semi-structured and unstructured data\n",
    "  - Contrast with traditional databases (schema on write)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Implementation in Hive\n",
    "  - `CREATE TABLE flexible_data (col1 STRING, col2 STRING, col3 STRING);`\n",
    "  - Data type conversion happens during query execution\n",
    "  - SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer) handles format interpretation\n",
    "    * JSON SerDe for JSON data\n",
    "    * Regex SerDe for custom text formats\n",
    "    * Avro SerDe for Avro files\n",
    "  - NULL values returned for incompatible data types\n",
    "\n",
    "• Advantages and considerations\n",
    "  - **Fast data ingestion**: No validation overhead during loading\n",
    "  - **Schema flexibility**: Handle varying data structures\n",
    "  - **Storage efficiency**: Store raw data without transformation\n",
    "  - **Query-time overhead**: Type conversion during each query\n",
    "  - **Data quality**: Potential issues discovered only during queries\n",
    "  - **Best practices**: Validate critical data paths and common queries\n",

    "    * Slower but safer for problematic data distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "• Split column requirements and considerations\n",
    "  - Must be numeric, date, or timestamp data type\n",
    "  - Should have good data distribution across value ranges\n",
    "  - Avoid columns with many null values or highly skewed data\n",
    "  - More mappers increase speed but also increase database server load\n",
    "  - Optimal mapper count usually 2-4 per CPU core in cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Importing Partial Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "• WHERE clause filtering\n",
