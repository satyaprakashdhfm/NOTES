    "Nice — now you’re moving from *basic search* into *exam-style shell scripting and text-processing*. That’s where commands like `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, and `wc` shine together.\n",

    "### Common Text-Processing Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Count words in the first line of a file\n",
    "head -n 1 file.txt | wc -w\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "`head -n 1` gets the first line → `wc -w` counts words.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Count letters (characters) in the 30th line\n",
    "sed -n '30p' file.txt | wc -m\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "`sed -n '30p'` prints only the 30th line → `wc -m` counts total characters (including spaces).\n",
