    "\n",
    "**VERBAL ABILITY ERROR CORRECTION TYPES**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Redundant Contrasting Conjunctions and Related Errors**\n",
    "example question: \"Even though it was raining, but we still went for a walk.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"Even though it was raining, we still went for a walk.\" or \"It was raining, but we still went for a walk.\" \"Even though\" and \"but\" both signal contrast—using both repeats the same function and is redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Misuse of \"despite\" and \"in spite of\"**\n",
    "example question: \"Despite of the traffic, we arrived on time.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"Despite the traffic, we arrived on time.\" or \"In spite of the traffic, we arrived on time.\" \"Despite\" already includes \"of,\" so adding \"of\" is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Redundant Use of \"because\" and \"reason\"**\n",
    "example question: \"The reason I'm late is because my car broke down.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"The reason I'm late is that my car broke down.\" or \"I'm late because my car broke down.\" Don't pair \"reason\" + \"because\"—either use \"reason… is that\" or simply \"because.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Double Comparatives or Superlatives**\n",
    "example question: \"This is more better than I expected.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"This is better than I expected.\" You can't use \"more\" with an already comparative adjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Misplaced \"only\"**\n",
    "example question: \"I only eat vegetables.\" (meaning you eat nothing else)\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"I eat only vegetables.\" \"Only\" must immediately precede the word or phrase it modifies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Redundant Prepositions**\n",
    "example question: \"Where are you at?\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"Where are you?\" The preposition \"at\" is unnecessary—\"where\" already expresses location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Misuse of \"like\" and \"as\"**\n",
    "example question: \"Do it like I showed you.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"Do it as I showed you.\" Use \"as\" to introduce clauses, \"like\" only before nouns or pronoun + noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Faulty Parallelism with Contrasting Ideas**\n",
    "example question: \"The movie was long but also it was boring.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"The movie was long but also boring.\" Keep coordinate elements parallel by omitting the repeated subject + verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Misplaced Modifiers with Contrasting Ideas**\n",
    "example question: \"Although broken, she still loved the antique vase.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"Although the vase was broken, she still loved it.\" The modifier must clearly refer to the vase, not \"she.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Redundant Negatives in Contrasting Statements**\n",
    "example question: \"She didn't say nothing, but she looked angry.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: Correct to \"She didn't say anything, but she looked angry.\" Two negatives cancel out—use a single negative + \"anything.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Redundancy in Verbs + Prepositions (\"discuss about,\" \"awaiting for\")**\n",
    "example question: \"We will discuss about the project tomorrow.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"We will discuss the project tomorrow.\" The verb \"discuss\" already takes a direct object—adding \"about\" is redundant.\n",
    "example question: \"The students were awaiting for the chief guest.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"The students were awaiting the chief guest.\" The verb \"await\" does not require \"for.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Wrong Verb Choice for Animate vs. Inanimate (\"got drowned\" vs. \"sink\")**\n",
    "example question: \"The ship got drowned in the storm.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"The ship sank in the storm.\" Only living beings \"drown\"; ships and objects \"sink.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. Correct Preposition in Phrasal Verb (\"put up at\" vs. \"put up in\")**\n",
    "example question: \"We put up in a hotel last night.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"We put up at a hotel last night.\" Use \"at\" for lodging at a general location; \"in\" for specific enclosed spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. Conditional Tense Sequence Errors**\n",
    "example question: \"If I had known this yesterday, I will have helped him.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"If I had known this yesterday, I would have helped him.\" Third conditional needs \"would have + past participle.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**15. Prepositional Distinctions (\"on behalf of\" vs. \"by\")**\n",
    "example question: \"She spoke by the committee.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"She spoke on behalf of the committee.\" \"On behalf of\" means as representative; \"by\" introduces the agent in passive voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**16. Incorrect Tense for Specific Past Events**\n",
    "example question: \"I have got my M.Sc. degree in 1988.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"I got my M.Sc. degree in 1988.\" Use simple past for actions at a definite past time, not present perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**17. Missing or Wrong Article with Adjectives**\n",
    "example question: \"It is meek and humble who shall inherit the earth.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"It is those who are meek and humble who shall inherit the earth.\" Or \"It is the meek and the humble …\" You need \"those\" or \"the\" to make it grammatical.\n",
    "\n",
    "**18. Adjective vs. Adverb and Comparative Forms**\n",
    "example question: \"The roses smell more sweetly than I thought.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"The roses smell sweeter than I thought.\" Use comparative adjective \"sweeter\" to compare a quality of the roses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**19. Subject-Verb Agreement & Capitalization**\n",
    "example question: \"Block of Residential flats are coming up near our house.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"A block of residential flats is coming up near our house.\" Singular subject \"block\" takes \"is,\" and mid-sentence \"residential\" is not capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**20. Redundancy in Relative Clauses**\n",
    "example question: \"You can get all the information that you want in this book.\"\n",
    "answer is and reason: \"You can get all the information you want in this book.\" The relative pronoun \"that\" is removable when it adds no new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**21. Quantity as Singular Subjects**\n",
    "example question: \"Sixty miles are a good distance.\"\n",
