    "\n",
    "- **React Framework vs Library**: React is primarily a library (small API surface for rendering HTML from JS), but with enough packages it feels like a framework\n",
    "- **Arrow Functions vs Regular Methods**: Arrow functions automatically bind `this` in React class components, preventing common \"undefined.setState\" errors\n",
    "- **State vs Props Rule**: If changing a value should update what users see → use state. If it's just data passed down → use props\n",
    "- **AJAX Advantages**: Better UX with no page reloads, reduced server load by sending only necessary data\n",
    "- **Virtual DOM**: React's in-memory UI representation that optimizes rendering performance\n",
    "- **JavaScript is single-threaded but non-blocking - it uses an event loop to handle async operations without freezing the browser. If fetch was synchronous, your entire page would freeze during network requests. Promises make fetch asynchronous, allowing other code to run while waiting for responses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    console.log('1. Start - runs immediately');\n",
    "\n",
    "    // If this was synchronous, it would FREEZE the browser here\n",
    "    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')\n",
    "    .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "    .then(data => console.log('4. API response received:', data.title));\n",
    "\n",
    "    console.log('2. This runs immediately (doesn\\'t wait for fetch)');\n",
    "\n",
    "    setTimeout(() => console.log('3. Timer callback'), 0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    console.log('5. End - also runs immediately');\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Output order: 1, 2, 5, 3, 4\n",
    "    // Synchronous code (1,2,5) runs first\n",
    "    // Then event loop processes async callbacks (3,4) when ready\n",

    "# 1. Core React Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Components & JSX\n",
    "\n",
    "### Component Definition\n",
    "A component is a reusable piece of UI that can be used as element in the jsx code where it starts with capital letter and normal html with small letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX Definition\n",
    "JSX is a syntax that combines JavaScript with HTML-like tags to create UI elements in React.\n",
    "\n",
    "### React Framework vs Library Debate\n",
    "Mainly: libraries help you accomplish a couple tasks; frameworks define your whole project, from how it does what it does to probably even your file structure and naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "React really only helps you render HTML from JS, and keep it in-sync with application state. That's it. Its API surface area is really small. That's why it's often considered a library, and not a framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you pile enough React packages on top of it, it can start to feel pretty frameworky. Does that make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Props vs State\n",
    "\n",
    "### Props\n",
    "Props are attributes passed from declaration of component.(in simple terms components are custom html elements and props are its attributes) - Props are read-only and can't be modified inside this component\n",
    "\n",
    "### State\n",
    "State is an object that stores dynamic data that determines how a component renders and behaves.( state is just a way for your component to \"remember\" things that might change, like user input, button clicks, or data from an API. When state changes, your component re-renders to show the new information.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> so in attribute when we pass a value that changes a variable and it renders whole component again in which it is declared is **state** and in attribute,a value passed to a child component form parent as simple value to a variable which is immutable is a **prop**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// App.jsx\n",
    "import { useState } from 'react' // Import useState hook from React\n",
    "import './App.css'\n",
    "\n",
    "// Child component - receives props from parent\n",
    "function Greeting(props) {\n",
    "  // useState hook creates state: likes is state value, setLikes changes it\n",
    "  // State is internal to component and can be modified\n",
    "  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      {/* Props are immutable values passed from parent */}\n",
    "      <h2>Hello, {props.name}!</h2>\n",
    "      <p>{props.message}</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "      {/* State value that changes and re-renders component */}\n",
    "      <p>Likes: {likes}</p>\n",
    "      <button onClick={() => setLikes(likes + 1)}>Like</button>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Parent component\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "  // useState hook: userName is state, setUserName updates it\n",
    "  // State lives inside component and triggers re-render when changed\n",
    "  const [userName, setUserName] = useState(\"John\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div className=\"container\">\n",
    "      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>\n",

    "      <Greeting \n",
    "        name={userName}        // State value passed as prop\n",
    "        message=\"Have a great day!\" \n",
    "      />\n",
    "      <Greeting \n",
    "        name=\"Sarah\"          // Direct value passed as prop\n",

    "# 2. React Hooks - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8EtggFGERCwMY5u5hOjf-h&si=Yp-vo3c24LAcPNH_\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Hook Definition & Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "A hook is a function that lets you use React features like state and lifecycle in functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules of Hooks (Must Follow!)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Only call hooks at the top level** - Never inside loops, conditions, or nested functions\n",
    "2. **Only call hooks from React functions** - React components or custom hooks only\n",
    "3. **Start custom hook names with \"use\"** - Like `useCustomHook`\n",
    "4. **Don't call hooks conditionally** - Same hooks must run in same order every render\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// ❌ WRONG - Don't do this\n",
    "function BadComponent() {\n",
    "  if (someCondition) {\n",
    "    const [state, setState] = useState(); // Never inside if!\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  \n",
    "  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {}); // Never inside loops!\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// ✅ CORRECT - Do this\n",
    "function GoodComponent() {\n",
    "  const [state, setState] = useState(); // Always at top level\n",
    "  \n",
    "  useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    if (someCondition) {\n",
    "      // Conditions inside hooks are fine\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  });\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Core React Hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useState Hook**: Lets functional components manage and update state.\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `const [stateValue, setStateFunction] = useState(initialValue);`\n",
    "  - to use setStateFunction we can set using direct value or function type(`setState(prevState => newState)`-arrow function without block , `setState(prevState => {return newState;})`-arrow function with block)\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "    const [name, setName] = useState('John');\n",
    "    const [items, setItems] = useState([]);\n",
    "    const [items, setItems] = useState({count:1,theme:'dark'})\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useEffect Hook**: Performs side effects like fetching data, subscriptions, timers.\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `useEffect(effectFunction, dependencyArray)`\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {}, []); // Run once on mount\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {}); // Run on every render\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {}, [count]); // Run when count changes\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - LifeCycle hook:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    React lifecycle hooks are functions that allow you to execute code at specific moments during a component's existence - when it's created, updated, or destroyed in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Key Points\n",
    "    • **Mounting**: Component is created and added to DOM - useEffect body runs\n",
    "    • **Updating**: Component re-renders due to state/prop changes - useEffect body runs again\n",
    "    • **Unmounting**: Component is removed from DOM - cleanup function (return) runs\n",
    "    • **Dependencies**: Control when effects run using dependency array `[value]`\n",
    "    • **Cleanup**: Always clean up timers, subscriptions to prevent memory leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Example\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  function UserProfile({ userId }) {\n",
    "    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n",
    "\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "      // MOUNTING/UPDATING: Fetch user data\n",
    "      fetchUser(userId).then(setUser);\n",
    "      \n",
    "      // UNMOUNTING: Cleanup function\n",
    "      return () => {\n",
    "        console.log('Cleaning up user profile');\n",
    "      };\n",
    "    }, [userId]); // Re-run when userId changes\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - **What happens if you DON'T have the cleanup function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Without cleanup:**\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "      const interval = setInterval(() => {\n",
    "        console.log('Running every second');\n",
    "      }, 1000);\n",
    "      // NO return - timer keeps running forever!\n",
    "    }, []);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Problems:**\n",
    "    - Timer runs FOREVER even after component is destroyed\n",
    "    - Memory leak - timer never stops\n",
    "    - If component mounts/unmounts multiple times, you get multiple timers running\n",
    "    - Browser gets slower and slower\n",
    "\n",
    "    **With cleanup:**\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "      const interval = setInterval(() => {\n",
    "        console.log('Running every second');\n",
    "      }, 1000);\n",
    "      \n",
    "      return () => clearInterval(interval); // Stops timer when component dies\n",
    "    }, []);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Think of it like:** \n",
    "    - You turn on a tap (useEffect)\n",
    "    - You MUST turn it off when you leave (cleanup function)\n",
    "    - If you don't turn it off, water keeps running and floods the house (memory leak)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The cleanup function is like turning off the tap when you're done!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useRef Hook**: Access DOM elements or store mutable values without re-renders.\n",
    "  - **Key Rule:** If changing the value should update what the user sees → use state. If it's just for internal tracking → use ref.\n",
    "  - | Use Case                | Purpose                                                                      |\n",
    "    | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "    | 📌 Access DOM           | Interact with real elements (`input`, `video`, `.click()`, `.focus()`, etc.) |\n",
    "    | 🧠 Store Mutable Values | Save values between renders without causing a re-render                      |\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);`\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    const inputRef = useRef(null);\n",
    "    const prevValue = useRef('');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "## 2.3 Additional React Hooks (Most Used 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useContext**: Access React Context values without Consumer wrapper.\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);`\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n",
    "    const user = useContext(UserContext);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useReducer**: Alternative to useState for complex state logic.\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);`\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useMemo**: Memoize expensive calculations to optimize performance.\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computation, dependencies);`\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => heavyCalculation(a, b), [a, b]);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useCallback**: Memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `const memoizedCallback = useCallback(callbackFunction, dependencies);`\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    const handleClick = useCallback(() => doSomething(a, b), [a, b]);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useLayoutEffect**: Similar to useEffect but fires synchronously after DOM mutations.\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `useLayoutEffect(effectFunction, dependencies);`\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    useLayoutEffect(() => {\n",
    "      // Runs before browser paints\n",
    "    }, []);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useImperativeHandle**: Customize the instance value exposed to parent components when using ref.\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `useImperativeHandle(ref, createHandle, dependencies);`\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({ focus: () => inputRef.current.focus() }));\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useDebugValue**: Displays a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.\n",
    "  - **Syntax:** `useDebugValue(value);`\n",
    "  - ```javascript\n",
    "    useDebugValue(isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Event Types\n",
    "- Functions that run when user interacts with elements.\n",
    "- Each event has a handler function that executes when the event happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Common Event Types:\n",
    "    - **onClick** - Runs when element is clicked\n",
    "    - **onChange** - Runs when input value changes  \n",
    "    - **onSubmit** - Runs when form is submitted\n",
    "    - **onMouseOver** - Runs when mouse hovers over element\n",
    "    - **onMouseOut** - Runs when mouse leaves element\n",
    "    - **onFocus** - Runs when element gets focus (clicked/tabbed to)\n",
    "    - **onBlur** - Runs when element loses focus\n",
    "    - **onKeyDown** - Runs when key is pressed down\n",
    "    - **onKeyUp** - Runs when key is released\n",
    "    - **onDoubleClick** - Runs when element is double-clicked\n",
    "    - **onScroll** - Runs when page/element is scrolled\n",
    "    - **onLoad** - Runs when page/image finishes loading\n",
    "-  why does onClick={() => increaseCount()} works AND why onClick={increaseCount()} or onClick={() => increaseCount} doesn't work?\n",
    "    - onClick={increaseCount()} -> React runs increaseCount as soon as this code is encountered. increaseCount changes state and causes a re-render, and in the next render cycle same thing happens causing a cycle. This should have infinite renders.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Class Components\n",
    "Class Components are the older way to create React components using ES6 classes. They were the primary way before React Hooks were introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Counter extends Component {\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components** refer to how form inputs manage their data in React.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controlled Components\n",
    "**React controls the input value** - the value is stored in React state and updated via event handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function ControlledInput() {\n",
    "  const [value, setValue] = useState('');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <input \n",
    "      value={value} // React controls this\n",
    "      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} // Update state\n",
    "    />\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Input value comes from React state\n",
    "- Changes handled by React event handlers\n",
    "- React is the \"single source of truth\"\n",
    "- Can validate/format input in real-time\n",
    "- Easy to reset, pre-populate, or transform data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncontrolled Components\n",
    "**DOM controls the input value** - React doesn't manage the value, just reads it when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function UncontrolledInput() {\n",
    "  const inputRef = useRef();\n",
    "  \n",
    "  const handleSubmit = () => {\n",
    "    console.log(inputRef.current.value); // Read from DOM\n",
    "  };\n",
    "  \n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <input \n",
    "      ref={inputRef} // Access DOM directly\n",
    "      defaultValue=\"initial value\" // Set initial value\n",
    "    />\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Input value managed by DOM\n",
    "- Use `ref` to access value when needed\n",
    "- Use `defaultValue` instead of `value`\n",
    "- Less React code, more like traditional HTML\n",
    "- Good for simple forms or integrating with non-React libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Controlled | Uncontrolled |\n",
    "|--------|------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Data source** | React state | DOM |\n",
    "| **Real-time validation** | ✅ Easy | ❌ Harder |\n",
    "| **Dynamic updates** | ✅ Easy | ❌ Manual |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Re-renders on change | No re-renders |\n",
    "| **Code complexity** | More setup | Less setup |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controlled**: Most form inputs, real-time validation, dynamic forms, search filters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uncontrolled**: Simple forms, file inputs (always uncontrolled), integrating with third-party libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Form() {\n",
    "  const [email, setEmail] = useState(''); // Controlled\n",
    "  const passwordRef = useRef(); // Uncontrolled\n",
    "  \n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <form>\n",
    "      <input \n",
    "        type=\"email\"\n",
    "        value={email}\n",
    "        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} \n",
    "      />\n",
    "      <input \n",
    "        type=\"password\"\n",
    "        ref={passwordRef}\n",
    "        defaultValue=\"\"\n",
    "      />\n",
    "    </form>\n",
    "  );\n",

    "## 7.1 React Portals\n",
    "\n",
    "**React Portals** let you render components outside their normal parent hierarchy in the DOM tree, while keeping them logically connected in the React component tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Problem Do Portals Solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, React components render inside their parent's DOM element. But sometimes you need to \"escape\" this - like for modals, tooltips, or dropdowns that need to appear on top of everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { createPortal } from 'react-dom'\n",
    "\n",
    "createPortal(children, domNode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Modals/Dialogs\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Modal({ children, isOpen }) {\n",
    "  if (!isOpen) return null;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Renders inside document.body instead of parent component\n",
    "  return createPortal(\n",
    "    <div className=\"modal-overlay\">\n",
    "      <div className=\"modal\">{children}</div>\n",
    "    </div>,\n",
    "    document.body\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Tooltips\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Tooltip({ text, targetElement }) {\n",
    "  return createPortal(\n",
    "    <div className=\"tooltip\">{text}</div>,\n",
    "    targetElement // Render near the target element\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Notifications/Toast\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Toast({ message }) {\n",
    "  return createPortal(\n",
    "    <div className=\"toast\">{message}</div>,\n",
    "    document.getElementById('toast-root') // Dedicated container\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSS stacking**: Escape z-index issues by rendering at document root\n",
    "- **Event bubbling**: Events still bubble up through React component tree (not DOM tree)\n",
    "- **Logical structure**: Component stays connected to its React parent for props/state\n",
    "- **Styling isolation**: Avoid CSS inheritance problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML Structure:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"root\">\n",
    "  <!-- Your main app -->\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<div id=\"modal-root\">\n",
    "  <!-- Portals render here -->\n",
    "</div>\n",
