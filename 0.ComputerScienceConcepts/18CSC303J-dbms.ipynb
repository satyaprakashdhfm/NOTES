    "**1. Database Service Types**\n",
    "- **Managed SQL Services**: RDS, Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL\n",
    "  - MySQL: Open-source database ideal for web applications\n",
    "  - PostgreSQL: Advanced features with high extensibility and standards compliance\n",
    "  - Oracle Database: Enterprise-grade with PL/SQL programming capabilities\n",
    "  - SQL Server: Microsoft ecosystem integration with T-SQL\n",
    "  - SQLite: Lightweight, embedded database for local applications\n",
    "- **NoSQL Database Services**\n",
    "  - Document databases: MongoDB, CouchDB for JSON-like documents\n",
    "  - Key-Value databases: Redis, DynamoDB, Memcached for simple lookup operations\n",
    "  - Wide-Column databases: Cassandra, HBase for time-series and IoT data\n",
    "  - Graph databases: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune for relationship-heavy data\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Specialized Database Systems**\n",
    "- **Time-Series Databases**: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB for time-stamped data\n",
    "- **In-Memory Databases**: Redis, Memcached for caching and real-time applications\n",
    "- **Vector Databases**: Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate for AI/ML embeddings and semantic search\n",
    "- **Search Engines**: Elasticsearch, Solr for full-text search capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Data Architecture Patterns**\n",
    "- **Database Architecture**: **Database = Storage Engine (InnoDB, WiredTiger) + Query Processor + Transaction Manager + Buffer Pool**\n",
    "\t- Traditional databases are *complete systems* with tightly coupled storage and compute, unlike lakes where they're separate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Warehouse Architecture**: **Data Warehouse = Columnar Storage + MPP Query Engine + ETL Pipeline + Metadata Layer**\n",
    "\t- Examples: Snowflake = Cloud Storage + Virtual Warehouses, BigQuery = Colossus + Dremel engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Mart Architecture**: **Data Mart = Subset of DW Data + Department-Specific Schema + Optimized Indexes + Access Controls**\n",
    "\t- It's essentially a *filtered view* of the warehouse, not separate infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ETL Architecture**: **ETL = Staging Area + Transform Engine (Informatica, SSIS) + Target Load**\n",
    "\t- Data is transformed *before* loading, requiring separate compute resources for transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ELT Architecture**: **ELT = Raw Load + In-Database Transform (dbt, Spark SQL) + Target Schema**\n",
    "\t- ELT leverages the *target system's compute* instead of separate transformation servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stream Processing Architecture**: **Stream Processing = Message Broker (Kafka) + Stream Engine (Flink, Kafka Streams) + State Store + Sink**\n",
    "\t- The *message broker* provides durability, the *engine* provides computation logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OLTP Architecture**: **OLTP = Row Storage + B-Tree Indexes + ACID Transactions + Connection Pooling**\n",
    "\t- OLTP optimizes for *single-row operations* with fast writes and consistent reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OLAP Architecture**: **OLAP = Columnar Storage + Bitmap Indexes + Parallel Query + Aggregation Cache**\n",
    "\t- OLAP optimizes for *bulk analytical scans* across millions of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Catalog Architecture**: **Data Catalog = Metadata Repository + Crawler/Scanner + Search Index + Lineage Graph + UI**\n",
    "\t- The *crawlers* discover assets, the *graph* tracks relationships, UI provides discovery interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Database Design Fundamentals**\n",
    "- **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\n",
    "- **Schema Design**: Proper normalization to reduce redundancy\n",
    "- **Key Management**: Primary keys for unique identification, foreign keys for referential integrity\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Indexing strategies and query optimization\n",
    "- **Data Integrity**: Constraints for validation and consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Big Data & Analytics Services**\n",
    "- **Data Warehousing**: Large-scale analytics solutions\n",
    "- **ETL/ELT Tools**: Data transformation and loading pipelines\n",
    "- **Real-time Analytics**: Streaming analytics platforms\n",
    "- **Data Catalog**: Metadata management services\n",
    "- **Business Intelligence**: Visualization and reporting tools\n",
    "- **Distributed Computing**: Spark and Hadoop frameworks for big data processing"
