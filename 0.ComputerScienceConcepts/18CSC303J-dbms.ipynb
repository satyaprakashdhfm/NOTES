    "Types of Databases\n",
    "Type\tDescription\tExample Systems\n",
    "Relational Databases (RDBMS)\tStore data in tables with rows and columns, use SQL for queries, enforce schemas and relationships\tMySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, SQL Server, SQLite\n",
    "NoSQL Databases\tFlexible schema, store data as documents, key-values, graphs, or wide-columns\tMongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (wide-column), Neo4j (graph)\n",
    "In-Memory Databases\tData stored in RAM for ultra-fast access, used for caching or real-time\tRedis, Memcached\n",
    "Time-Series Databases\tOptimized for time-stamped data (metrics, logs)\tInfluxDB, TimescaleDB\n",
    "Graph Databases\tStore data as nodes and edges for complex relationships\tNeo4j, Amazon Neptune\n",
    "Why relational databases are reliable and not scalable fast :\n",
    "\t• Hard to Scale Horizontally: Relational databases store tightly linked data, making it difficult to split across servers without complex joins and sharding logic.\n",
    "\t• Highly Reliable: They enforce ACID rules and strict schemas, ensuring every transaction is consistent and recoverable.\n",
    "\t• Built for Stability: Proven tools for backup, failover, and monitoring make them ideal for critical systems like banking and inventory.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Used Relational Databases:\n",
    "• MySQL(Oracle): Popular, open-source, widely used in web apps.\n",
    "• Oracle Database(PL/SQL): Enterprise-grade, rich features, costly.\n",
    "• PostgreSQL(opensource not by single company): Advanced features, highly extensible, strong support for complex queries.\n",
    "• SQLite(opensource not by single company): Lightweight, embedded DB for local/small apps.\n",
    "• SQL Server(Microsoft): Microsoft’s enterprise DB, well integrated with Windows ecosystem.(t-sql only in microsoft sql)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Category\tMySQL (InnoDB)\tPostgreSQL\tSQL Server\n",
    "Performance & Scalability\t- Optimized for simple primary-key lookups and read caching- Can hit transaction contention on very write-heavy workloads without careful tuning\t- MVCC implementation avoids lock contention- Multicore parallel query execution gives strong mixed-load performance\t- Cost-based optimizer with mature parallelism excels at complex analytical queries, especially on Windows-tuned hardware\n",
    "Feature Set & Standards Compliance\t- Basic SQL-92 compliance; advanced features like full CTEs arrived late- Widely supported by ORMs with minimal dialect quirks\t- One of the most standards-compliant RDBMSes- Full support for window functions, recursive CTEs, custom types, multiple procedural languages (PL/pgSQL, PL/Python)\t- Proprietary T-SQL extensions (TRY…CATCH, MERGE, CLR integration)- Rich procedural capabilities but less portability\n",
    "Extensibility & Ecosystem\t- Pluggable storage engines (InnoDB, MyISAM, MyRocks)- Large plugin market but limited user-defined function support\t- Unbeatable extensibility: custom operators, index types (GIN, GiST), domain types- First-class extensions like PostGIS, TimescaleDB\t- CLR-based extensions, deep Azure integration (Data Factory, Synapse)- Locked into Microsoft ecosystem\n",
    "Tooling & Developer Experience\t- Lightweight CLI tools (mysql, mysqldump)- Ubiquitous hosting support (cPanel, AWS RDS)- No single unified GUI for profiling\t- Mature CLI (psql, pg_dump), robust backup/recovery (pgBackRest, WAL archiving)- Vibrant GUIs (pgAdmin, DBeaver)\t- Industry-standard SSMS/Visual Studio integration- Built-in profiler, Activity Monitor, Tuning Advisor- Heavier install, Windows-centric\n",
    "Licensing & Total Cost of Ownership\t- Open-source GPL or commercial Oracle editions- Low cost but potential vendor lock-in on Oracle forks\t- BSD-licensed; free for any use- Many cloud-hosted managed options with no licensing overhead\t- Commercial Core/CAL licensing can be expensive- Free Express edition limited by CPU/RAM\n",
    "• CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Named, temporary result sets defined using the WITH keyword that you can reference within a single query to break complex queries into readable, reusable parts (e.g., recursive or multi-step data transformations).\n",
    "• SQL Dialects: Vendor-specific variations of SQL syntax and features (like T-SQL for SQL Server or PL/pgSQL for PostgreSQL) that extend or modify standard SQL, causing slight “quirks” in how queries must be written or functions behave.\n",
    "• ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers): Tools that let you interact with databases using code (like Python or Java classes) instead of raw SQL, converting objects into database rows automatically.\n",
    "\t• Examples: SQLAlchemy (Python), Hibernate (Java), and Django ORM simplify data handling, migrations, and queries while reducing SQL boilerplate.\n",

By default for keyword like insert .A stored procedure is a user defined piece of code written in the local version of PL/SQL, which may return a value (making it a function) that is invoked by calling it explicitly. A trigger is a stored procedure that runs automatically when various events happen (eg update, insert, delete).\n",

    "\t• Embedded apps (Chrome, Candy Crush, CapCut) rely on SQLite locally.\n",
    "\t• Exact internal architectures can vary by region and over time; above reflects the most cited public information.\n",
