    "Clock Cycles in GPU vs. CPU\n",
    "Clock cycles define how many instructions a processor can execute per second, typically measured in GHz. However, CPUs and GPUs handle instructions differently due to their architectural differences.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    1. Clock Speed Comparison\n",
    "    Processor\tTypical Clock Speed (GHz)\tExecution Style\n",
    "    CPU (Central Processing Unit)\t2 - 5 GHz\tHigh clock speed, low parallelism\n",
    "    GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)\t0.5 - 2 GHz\tLower clock speed, massive parallelism\n",
    "     \n",
    "    2. Clock Cycles per Instruction\n",
    "    Factor\tCPU\tGPU\n",
    "    Instruction Latency\tLow (few cycles per instruction)\tHigh (many cycles per instruction)\n",
    "    Pipeline Depth\tShorter, optimized for sequential execution\tDeeper, optimized for parallel execution\n",
    "    Parallelism\tFew cores (multi-threaded execution)\tThousands of cores (SIMD execution)\n",
    "     \n",
    "    3. Why Do GPUs Have Lower Clock Speeds?\n",
    "        ○ Massive Parallelism: GPUs execute thousands of threads at once, reducing reliance on high clock speeds.\n",
    "        ○ Power Efficiency: High clock speeds increase power consumption and heat, which isn't ideal for GPUs.\n",
    "        ○ Memory Bottleneck: GPUs focus on memory bandwidth rather than single-threaded execution speed.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    4. Key Differences: CPU vs. GPU Clock Cycles\n",
    "    Feature\tCPU\tGPU\n",
    "    Optimization\tLow-latency tasks, fast sequential execution\tHigh-throughput, massive parallel execution\n",
    "    Clock Cycles per Task\tLower (faster per instruction)\tHigher (but executes many instructions in parallel)\n",
    "    Latency Sensitivity\tCritical (faster single-thread performance)\tLess critical (hides latency with parallelism)\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Conclusion\n",
    "        ○ CPUs rely on high clock speeds and low latency for sequential processing.\n",
    "        ○ GPUs rely on massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, compensating for lower clock speeds.\n",
    " \n",
    "What Are FLOPs?\n",
    "    FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second) measure the computational performance of a processor, especially for tasks involving floating-point arithmetic (e.g., AI, scientific computing, gaming).\n",
    "    1. FLOPs Formula\n",
    "    FLOPs=Clock Speed×Number of Cores×Operations Per Cycle\\text{FLOPs} = \\text{Clock Speed} \\times \\text{Number of Cores} \\times \\text{Operations Per Cycle}\n",
    "        ○ Clock Speed (GHz) → How fast a processor runs.\n",
    "        ○ Number of Cores → More cores allow parallel execution.\n",
    "        ○ Operations Per Cycle → CPUs typically execute fewer per cycle, while GPUs execute many.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    FLOPs in CPU vs. GPU\n",
    "    Feature\tCPU\tGPU\n",
    "    Typical FLOPs\t10-100 GFLOPs(GigaFLOPs)\tTFLOPs (TeraFLOPs) to PFLOPs (PetaFLOPs)\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Why Do GPUs Have More FLOPs Than CPUs?\n",
    "        a. Parallel Execution → GPUs handle thousands of operations simultaneously.\n",
    "        b. Specialized Hardware → Uses SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and Tensor Cores for massive FLOP gains.\n",
    "        c. Memory Bandwidth → High-speed VRAM (GDDR, HBM) reduces bottlenecks.\n",
    "        d. Lower Clock Speeds but More Cores → Unlike CPUs, GPUs prioritize more cores over high clock speeds.\n",

    "        NVIDIA A100 (Data Center GPU)\t~19.5 TFLOPs (FP64)\n",
    "        🔹 A high-end GPU like the RTX 4090 has ~40x more FLOPs than a top CPU! 🚀\n",
